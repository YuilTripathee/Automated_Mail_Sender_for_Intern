# TODO

## #1: Auto content generation

This can be done based on snapshot filename (cause of limits of currently existing technologies).

Possible solution include:

1. Use snapshot and attachment filename. Remove file extensions.
2. Create a **HIGHLIGHTS** list and render into the mail body.

## #2: File disposer

## #3: Graphical User Interface version

## #4: Autopilot feature

## #5: Usage analytics

## #6: Optimize code redundancy using user defined libraries
