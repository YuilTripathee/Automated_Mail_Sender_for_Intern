# Automated Mail Sender 📨

[TOC]

## About the project 📨

This project was developed such that I could report to my advisors on regular basis, without missing out any days (kind of newsletter). The content can be updated on asynchronous basis.

**Before**: Write mail every 4 PM to supervisors.

**After**: I update content any time of the day as the task is done. Then, `cron` job sends mail at exact reporting hours.

### Usage algorithm

This is for extended version since minified version is much intuitive to use.
Here's how to use this program:

1. Run the program
   
   > `python3 mail_confirm.py`
2. Choose if you are ready to send the email. Options [y/N]
3. Check if sender information is correct. Edit by entering `N` or enter `y` if the information is correct.
4. Check if the receiver informatio is correct. Enter by entering `N` or enter `y` if the information is correct.
5. Check if the cc list is correct. Enter `y` if the list is correct or enter `N` and the cc list will be discarded (no cc in the mail you'll be sending).
6. Choose if you would consider using the predefined template for mail message. The message will be in HTML and few of the message templates may be stored in project directory : `message\template.json`. Enter `y` if you'll use the template or enter `N` if you are not using it.
   1. The available templates with the label will be  presented. Choose if you are going to use from the defined template `y` or write in on your own `N`.
   2. If you choose `y`: Enter the template id from the list presented above (with the label), note that you are only entering the id number.
   3. If you choose `N`: Enter the template message, as new line is left empty and you press enter, you can't write multiline template any more for a while. Enter the label for the custom template you just made. The template will then be saved to your project directory in `message\template.json` so that you could use it later.
7. Choose if you are adding some extra text other than a template; enter `y` if you are or enter `N` if you are not going to enter some extra texts below the template. Here, multiline input implies the same rule as you were writing for a custom template.
8. Then, images will be attached from `snapshots\` folder and the mail page will be properly rendered and saved as `mail\mail.html`. The file will then be loaded into the main `sendmail.py` scipt.
9. Enter you password to log in to the email provider (`smtp.gmail.com:587` in this case: you can change if you need to).
10. As you log in, the mail will be sent to the recipent with the cc in presence of validity of configuration you've provided earlier.

## Program flow

```txt

start.sh
|
v
mail_confirm.py
| |
| |-----> min/sendmail.py <--> min/html_mail_writer.py
|-------> sendmail.py <--> html_mail_writer.py

Hence, the bot is able to send mail via SMTP protocol in MIME format.
